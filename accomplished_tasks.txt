Accomplished Tasks in the Casino Automation Project:

Core Automation & Web Interaction:

1. Implemented Web Automation: Successfully automated interactions with online casino affiliate websites using Playwright.
2. Simulated User Behavior: Designed the system to find and click "signup" or "play now" buttons on affiliate sites, mimicking real user behavior.
3. Handled Diverse Site Layouts: Created affiliate-specific handlers (`handle_xxx` methods) to adapt to different website structures and designs.
4. Bypassed Basic Bot Detection: Integrated `playwright-stealth` to reduce the chances of being detected as an automated bot.
5. Integrated Proxy Support: Configured proxy usage (CatProxies) to allow the automation to appear to be coming from different geographic locations.
6. Managed different countries: The automation manages different countries and their sites.
7. Managed Cookies: Implemented automatic handling of cookie consent popups.
8. Managed Dynamic content: Add a logic to wait for dynamic content
9. Managed specific sites: Add specific logic per site, to adapt to the design.
10. Managed blacklisted sites: Add a blacklisted site feature.

Data Tracking & Analytics:

11. Tracked Casino Clicks: Logged every successful casino click, including the casino name, timestamp, and affiliate source.
12. Maintained Click History: Created a detailed history log of all interactions, providing a chronological record.
13. Captured Screenshots: Took screenshots of the clicked casino pages for reference and analysis.
14. Stored Statistics: Stored click statistics, history, and screenshot paths in a `stats.json` file.
15. Calculated Key Metrics: Calculated total clicks, unique casinos clicked, and the most frequently clicked casino.
16. Managed concurrency: Used threads to manage concurrent access to the stats.
17. Managed logs: The project is managing logs with the logging module.

Web Interface & User Experience:

18. Developed a Flask Web Application: Built a dynamic web interface using Flask to control and monitor the automation.
19. Implemented Real-Time Updates: Integrated `Flask-SocketIO` to provide live updates to the web interface without page refreshes.
20. Created a Control Panel: Provided a way to start, stop, and enable continuous mode for the automation.
21. Designed a Dashboard: Displayed real-time statistics in an easy-to-understand format.
22. Built a History Section: Showcased a detailed log of all interactions with timestamps and links to screenshots.
23. Added Settings: Added a section to reset the data.
24. Created Charts: Used Chart.js to create dynamic pie chart to view the casino distribution and line chart to view the click history over time.

26. Managed Status: add a status bar.
27. Add Notifications: Added notifications for specific actions and errors.
28. Responsive design: The website is responsive.

Concurrency & Efficiency:

29. Implemented Multi-threading: Used Python's `threading` module to run multiple automation tasks concurrently, significantly improving efficiency.
30. Managed Task Queue: Employed `queue.Queue` to manage tasks and distribute them to worker threads.
31. Managed automation mode: add an infinite automation mode.

Project Structure & Maintenance:

32. Organized Project Structure:  Structured the project into separate files for core automation, the web application, static assets, and data storage.
33. Included Dependency Management: Used a `requirements.txt` file to manage Python dependencies.
34. Documented the Project: Created a `README.md` file to provide clear instructions for setup, usage, and configuration.
35. Created a Configuration: Created a configuration to manage different parameter of the automation.
36. Managed Errors: The project is managing errors, and notify the user.
